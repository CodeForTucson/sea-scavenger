            <h1>Welcome to Sea Scavenger!</h1>
            <p>In this game, you are part of the circular economy.</p>
            <p>What is a circular economy? We're glad you asked!
                In a circular economy, nothing goes to waste. Instead, when
                goods reach the end of their life, they are remanufactured into
                something new.
            </p>
            <p>Your task in this game is to recover plastic waste from the
                coasts of countries around the world so the items can be made
                into something new.
            </p>
            <p>For each turn, you will be given a mission to recover a specific 
                type of plastic waste. You then choose the country your team will
                recover the plastic from to achieve the mission. If there is 
                enough of that type of plastic waste at that location, you will
                succeed and get a new mission. If you don't retrieve enough waste,
                the game is over.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>
